## Sum square difference
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

``12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385``

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

``(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025``

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
